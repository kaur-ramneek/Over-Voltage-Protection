# Over-Voltage-Protection
Over voltage protection is a power supply feature which shuts down the supply, or clamps the output, when the voltage exceeds a preset level.
Most power supplies use an over-voltage protection circuit to prevent damage to the electronic components. The impact of an over-voltage condition varies from one circuit to the other and ranges from damaging the components to degrading the components and causing circuit malfunctions or fire.
An over-voltage condition might occur in the power supply due faults inside the supply, or from external causes such as those in the distribution lines.
The magnitude and duration of the over-voltage are some of the major considerations when designing an effective protection. The protection involves setting a threshold voltage above which the control circuit shuts down the supply or diverts the extra voltage to other parts of the circuit such as capacitor.
Protection circuits, like reverse polarity protection, short-circuit protection and over/under voltage protection, are used to protect any electronic appliance or circuit from any sudden mis-happening. Generally fuse or MCB is used for overvoltage protection, here in this circuit, we will build an overvoltage protection circuit without using Fuse.
